## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS preprocessor
- CSS custom properties
- CSS pseudo elements
- CSS pseudo classes
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascript Functional
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this challenge, I finally learned CSS pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements. I struggled with them for a long time, and in this challenge, I used them in nearly every section. For example, in the form section, the error alert is all made using pseudo-elements, the error icon is a ::before element, and the message below the input is an ::after element. Another example is the background behind the illustrations. They are made using ::after because they need to expand through the entire screen, which couldn't be done using background-image.
